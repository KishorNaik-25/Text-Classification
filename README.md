The problem at hand involves text classification, where the goal is to analyze customer complaint text and categorize it into specific predefined classes or labels. In this particular case, a dataset of customer complaints has been obtained by web scraping using the Beautiful Soup Python library. This dataset comprises a total of 1945 rows, with each row representing a sentence or a piece of text. The key objective is to determine the appropriate category or label that best describes each customer complaint.

The dataset is structured with two main features: the text itself, which contains the customer complaints, and the corresponding label that indicates the category or class to which each complaint belongs. The text classification task is essential for automating the process of categorizing and addressing customer complaints efficiently.

To address this task, a machine learning model known as PerceiverForSequenceClassification has been chosen. This model is designed to handle sequence classification tasks effectively. Additionally, a specific tokenizer called PerceiverTokenizer has been used to preprocess and encode the text data, making it suitable for input to the Perceiver model. This combination of model and tokenizer facilitates the classification of customer complaints into predefined categories, streamlining the process of understanding and responding to customer feedback.
